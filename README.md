# console-1

A demonstration of a simulation of the Atari 800 command line console, running on a web page, just for fun.

It currently includes a lower case font, keyboard "click" sounds, text scrolling, cursor shapes, and blinking cursors.

It's based on several-year old JavaScript I wrote several years ago; hence I am in the process of modernizing it to current JavaScript documentation and coding conventions.

To run, just set up a web server (a simple Node/JavaScript server will do) to serve the repo folder on a particular port (say 8888), and then point your web brouwser to the index.html file using that port (http://localhost:8888//index.html).
