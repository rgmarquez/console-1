# console-1

A demonstration of a simulation of the Atari 800 command line console, running on a web page, just for fun.

It currently includes a lower case font, keyboard "click" sounds, text scrolling, cursor shapes, and blinking cursors.

It's based on several-year old JavaScript I wrote several years ago; hence I am in the process of modernizing it to current JavaScript documentation and coding conventions.

To run, just set up a web server (a simple Node/JavaScript server will do) to serve the repo folder on a particular port (say 8888), and then point your web brouwser to the index.html file using that port (http://localhost:8888//index.html).

The "fun" for me was creating routines to convert the eight 8-bit values representing each character glyph/bitmap, and converting them to drawable shapes.

For example, the letter "A" bitbap is [0, 24, 60, 102, 102, 126, 102, 0], stored as 8-bit values; each 8-bit value encoded the "on" or "off" pixels in each row of the letter's image:

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0
0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0
0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0
0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0
0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
